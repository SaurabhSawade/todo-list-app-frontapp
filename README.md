üõ†Ô∏è Enhancement Decisions

During the enhancement process of the To-Do List full-stack application, the following key decisions were made:
	‚Ä¢	Context API for State Management: Used React‚Äôs Context API to manage the global state of todos efficiently, enabling shared access to CRUD operations across components.
	‚Ä¢	REST API Integration: Connected the React frontend to a Node.js + Express backend using Axios for seamless communication with MongoDB via Mongoose.
	‚Ä¢	Component Structure: Divided the UI into reusable components like TodoForm, TodoItem, and TodoList for better readability and maintainability.
	‚Ä¢	Error Handling: Implemented try-catch blocks and user input validation to ensure smoother user experience and improved backend stability.
	‚Ä¢	UI Feedback: Added basic visual feedback (e.g., input clearing, checkbox toggle, background color changes) to indicate completed vs. pending tasks.
	‚Ä¢	Deployment:
	‚Ä¢	Backend deployed on Render to provide a reliable API endpoint.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend deployed on Netlify for fast, globally available access.

These decisions improved both user experience and codebase scalability, making the application easier to maintain and expand in the future.
